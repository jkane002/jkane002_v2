        <p>Recent UC Riverside graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Currently looking for
            a full-time software engineering position in Python development.</p>
        <p>During my college career, I participated in a plethora of programming-related projects such as
            developing a virtual reality game, coding rendering scripts, directing an animated short in Maya,
            and
            building the user interface for an Android app. I also interned with the USC Institute for Creative
            Technologies
            and built their animation pipeline using Unity3D Game Engine.</p>
        <p>Outside of tech, I have a couple of side hustles — thrift reselling and investing in the stock
            market —
            which have taught me the value of data analytics, research, financial technology (Fintech), and
            customer
            service. </p>
